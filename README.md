# Calculator with Java

## Introduction
This was a simple Java exercise in creating a class and methods. The challenge was to create a Calculator that would accept user input and perform Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, and Division. The user should also be able to Clear and Quit.

## Usage 
1. Run the command javac in order to compile the Java program
    ```JS
   javac Calculator.java
    ```
2. Run the command java in order to execute the bytecode of Java
    ```JS
   java Calculator.java
    ```

## Functionality
* The Calculator will prompt the user to enter a first number, an operator, and then a second number.
* If at any point, the user enters invalid input, the Calculator will prompt the user to enter valid input.
* Entering 'c' will clear the current input.
* Entering 'q' will quit the program.
